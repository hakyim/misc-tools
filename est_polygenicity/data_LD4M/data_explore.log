Conclusion: l2l4 maf_bin is a subset of UK10K common SNPs.
1414192 SNPs in l2l4 non-maf_bin.
8 SNPs in l2l4 non-maf_bin are common in UK10K.
Among these, 2 SNPs are common in 1000G.
94507 SNPs in l2l4 non-maf_bin are common in 1000G.
Final conclusion: 
1. l2l4 maf_bin is a subset of UK10K common SNPs. 
2. l2l4 non-maf_bin is almost not common in UK10K. 
3. |l2l4 maf_bin| = 4812921; |UK10K common| = 5353593
4. Aggregate the results from the non-overlapping l2l4 maf_bin bins. It may be slightly smaller than the one from UK10K common since it contains fewer SNPs.
